# Collatz_conjecture
This very simple program explore and return the values of the Collatz conjecture for a chosen number. 

The Collatz conjecture:

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
The Collatz conjecture is: "This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.".

It's an interesting process, because we are still far away to reach an explanation of this phaenomenon.
